                <p>I have been working as a web developer since 2008. I am skilled in design, front-end and server side technologies. I am constantly improving my skillset by seeking out the latest technologies and techniques. Take a look at my <a href="skillset.php">skillset</a> for a full list of technologies I use. I deliver unique, original, easy-to-use applications that clients love, take a look at my <a href="portfolio.php">portfolio</a> for a selection of my work.</p>

                <p>Outside of work I enjoy nothing more than taking the top down on my Porsche and going for a drive. I love all kinds of sports cars, you will often find me at a track driving the latest super cars. Despite owning a Porsche and having driven Ferarris, Astin Martins and Lamborghinis, my favourite car to drive is the Nissan GTR.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I volunteer at my local swimming club as a performance coach, having previously swam as a member of the British team, with a British record and various national and international medals, I now use my knowledge and experience to further the training of the next generation. When I am not coaching I train with the City of Bristol performance squad and compete in various senior age competitions, achieving 8th in Britain in the 100m butterfly (2013).</p>
