                            <p>Bikely is a cycling route mapping application that I working on during my time at Future Publishing. The original website was very bland and difficult to use so I completly rebuilt the front-end with a fresh new design, using backbone and include to power the application which interfaces with GoogleMaps API to provide a seemless user experience.</p>

                            <p>OrbitD is a personal project of mine. It is a brand new CMS with a twist, unlike most CMS, OrbitD does not use templates of any kind. It is a pure Drag and Drop website builder that allows users to create any style website they like with ease. It is powered by jQuery with a PHP back end, built upon the Twitter bootstrap. It is still under development but I hope to release it soon. Please get in touch if you would like a sandbox account.</p>

                                <p>A sporting hospitality comparison website I built partnered with a front-end developer. In order to create the advanced admin panel required to run this site I built an original custom CMS making this website 100% bespoke.</p>

It is built on a wordpress CMS giving the client complete control over the content.</p>

I also worked on a number of new features including social media integration.</p>
